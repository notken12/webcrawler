Chris Brown Throws Angry Fit After Robert Glasper Scores Best R&B Album Grammy
Trends Reporter, HuffPost
Chris Brown isn‚Äôt a happy camper after finding out he lost out on Best R&B Album to pianist Robert Glasper at the 65th Grammy Awards on Sunday night.
Voicing his anger over the loss, Brown fired shots at Glasper in a series of since-deleted posts on his Instagram Stories.
In one post, Brown wrote, ‚ÄúYall playing. Who da fuck is this?‚Äù alongside a picture of Glasper and several crying-laughing emojis.
The ‚ÄúGo Crazy‚Äù singer, who has received 21 Grammy nominations throughout his career and earned a Best R&B Album Grammy in 2012 for ‚ÄúF.A.M.E.,‚Äù didn‚Äôt stop the bashing there.
‚ÄúWho the f*ck is Robert Glasper,‚Äù he continued in the utmost sore-loser fashion. ‚ÄúIma keep kicking yall ass! Respectfully.‚Äù

Glasper, who has written and produced albums for hitmakers including Kendrick Lamar, Mac Miller, Common and Talib Kweli, has received 12 nods across eight categories throughout his musical career.
He has also landed four Grammys, including Best R&B Song in 2021 for ‚ÄúBetter Than I Imagined‚Äù alongside singer H.E.R.
The pianist took home the Best R&B Album award Sunday night for his ‚ÄúBlack Radio III‚Äù album over Brown‚Äôs 10th album, ‚ÄúBreezy (Deluxe),‚Äù Mary J. Blige‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning Gorgeous (Deluxe),‚Äù Lucky Daye‚Äôs ‚ÄúCandydrip‚Äù and PJ Morton‚Äôs ‚ÄúWatch the Sun.‚Äù
Wrapping up his roasting session against Glasper, Brown concluded with a dose of sarcasm: ‚ÄúI gotta get my skills up‚Ä¶Ima start playing the harmonica.‚Äù
Alongside an edited image of himself playing the harmonica, he quipped, ‚ÄúNew Level Unlocked! Harmonica Breezy.‚Äù
It didn‚Äôt take long for Twitter users to call out the crooner over his immature behavior.
‚ÄúChris Brown has 20 nominations and 1 win. He taking out his frustrations on Robert Glasper but them 19 Ls are the real enemy,‚Äù one Twitter user wrote.
Another wrote, ‚ÄúChris Brown not knowing who Robert Glasper is‚Ä¶ is the reason all of Chris Brown songs sound the same.‚Äù
‚ÄúChris Brown having no idea who Robert Glasper and proceeding to come for him perfectly explains why his music hasn‚Äôt grown or matured in 15 years,‚Äù said another.
Chris Brown‚Äôs upset he lost to Robert Glasper? Oh. pic.twitter.com/fQBFog5v5A
Chris Brown trying to be shady towards Robert Glasper isn't funny at all. Robert been one of the most talented musicians in Hip Hop for over a decade now. Black Radio 3 is an AMAZING album. Put some respect on his name.
