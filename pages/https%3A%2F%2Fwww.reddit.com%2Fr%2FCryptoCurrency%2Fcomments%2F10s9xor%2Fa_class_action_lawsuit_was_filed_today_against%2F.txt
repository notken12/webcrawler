A class action lawsuit was filed today against Logan Paul and associates for their role in CryptoZoo
It's a 26-page document. The highlights:
Lawsuit filed on 2/2/2023 in the Western District of Texas
The defendants are Logan Paul, Danielle Strobel, Jeffrey Levin, Eduardo Ibanez, Crypto King, and Ben Roth
The lead plaintiff is a police officer who purchased $3,000 worth of CryptoZoo tokens
It is alleged that Jake Paul and associates executed a rug pull by silently purchasing Zoo tokens on Binance Chain and then dumping on customers when the project was publicly announced
Additional allegations of fraud, breach of contract, and false marketing as a result of failing to disclose that the project was non-functional, and not delivering on promotional items
