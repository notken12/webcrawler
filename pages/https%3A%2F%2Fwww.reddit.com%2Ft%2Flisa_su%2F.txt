Silly question! What did Lisa Su meant by "AM4 support will continue for years to come"?
Do you guys think she meant only in the software side of things? Maybe more X3D launches? I think it would be neat if they launched a final R5 5600X3D as the end of the socket for the ultimate budget CPU if priced right, or maybe that and a R9 5950X3D as the ultimate upgrade for those still in AM4. Just imagine, if the R7 5800X3D is already close to the new flagship CPUs of both AMD and Intel, something better than that on AM4 would maybe mean ultimate value if a CPU like that is even possible or even good for AMD themselves lol.
ReTurdX 4080 is 1200 Illuminati tickets and it's barely any better than 3090 Ti (and worse than even 3080 Ti, in Boringfarts 3). It's over. Lisa Su won. AMD won. Radeon won. #BETTERED.
