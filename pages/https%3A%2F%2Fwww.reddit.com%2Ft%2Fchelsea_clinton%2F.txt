Possible spoiler, if you havent seen the 3rd season.
First, I think it was AMAZING that Chelsea cameo 'd at the end! I think I glee-sqealed. But I was recently thinking, do you think Chelsea would have tried to reply after receiving the letter 20+ years late? I think she would have. I mean, THE REAL CHELSEA did the show. I think Canon Chelsea would have tried to write. Probably would have gotten to Erin first because Mary and Jerry live in the same house.
What do you think? How would the girls have responded?
