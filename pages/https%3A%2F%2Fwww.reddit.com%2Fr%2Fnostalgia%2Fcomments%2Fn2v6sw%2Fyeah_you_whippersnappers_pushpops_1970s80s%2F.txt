<START>Yeah, you whipper-snappers! (Push-pops, 1970s-80s)
Mine were always the Flintstones for some reason.
The orange Flintstones ones were awesome
It wasn’t even ice cream...fuckin’ sherbet...
The reason is that you are less old. There was a lot less branding in the late 70s early 80s.
"For some reason"
Cause they are the best
Did you ever make the cardboard Flinstones-mobile on the back? The used tubes made the wheels!
Definitely a 90s thing
I ate an entire one in one bite on a dare and had brain freeze so bad I begged my mom to take me to the hospital before it went away.
Orange/pink flintstones push pops from the local gas station or corner mart were for sure a part of early 90s kids life. Can still taste the subtle cardboard undertones.
They still make these don't they? Just got my kid one at 7-11 the other day.
Same!!!
Guess push up pops from the stone ages so it wasn’t specific to just his day *pshh
The "some reason" was Ted Turner. He bought a shit ton of old cartoons, which led to the creation of Cartoon Network and in its first few years it ran reruns of all of those old cartoons.

We had these in the 90s too.
and in the 00s
We have these now. I literally bought one the other day at a gas station.
Yeah and they were called push-ups. Push pop is a hard candy. Also from the 90s.
You can buy them at your local grocer today!
