LSU basketball star Flau‚Äôjae Johnson scored big points as a rapper on Monday‚Äôs episode of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Got Talent: All-Stars.‚Äù (Watch the video at bottom.)
It should come as no surprise that she ignored the pressure onstage.
Dubbed a ‚Äúfreshman phenom‚Äù on the court by ESPN, she makes shots like this for the No. 3 ranked and undefeated Tigers:

Johnson was just 14 when she made the quarterfinals on Season 13 of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Got Talent.‚Äù She signed with Jay-Z‚Äôs Roc Nation and was later invited back to the ‚ÄúAGT‚Äù franchise for unfinished business.
In her intro on Monday, she said she devoted her first appearance to fulfilling the legacy of her father, a rapper who was slain before she was born. This time, she said, ‚ÄúI get to tell my story.‚Äù
Oozing self-assurance, the hoopster rapped about shooting the 3 and how others ‚Äúmistake my confidence for arrogance.‚Äù
Judge Howie Mandel called her ‚Äúmy MVP.‚Äù Fellow panelist Heidi Klum said Johnson was talented and wise beyond her years.
‚ÄúYou came back so much better than you were before,‚Äù Simon Cowell said.
Johnson did not advance to the final, but on Tuesday tweeted out a thank-you for Mandel‚Äôs praise.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give up today, tomorrow might be the day that I win!!‚Äù she wrote later.
I can‚Äôt give up today, tomorrow might be the day that I win !!
