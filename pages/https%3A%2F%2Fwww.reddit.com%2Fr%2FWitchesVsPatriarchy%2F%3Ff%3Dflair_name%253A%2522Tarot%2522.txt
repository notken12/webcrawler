Thinking about embroidering my own tarot/altar cloth, is it a good idea? Would it cause any nevative energy?
My first tarot card spread. I have a lot to learn, but the deck was too beautiful not to grab a picture. ‚ù§Ô∏è

About
Though women-centric, we welcome all beings interested in using their esoteric powers to destroy the Patriarchy and all its constraints on women, men, and everybody in between and beyond.
Taking a more historic approach to the concept of witches, this sub is meant to channel the spirit of the women who were persecuted in witch trials worldwide as part of a thinly veiled systemic oppression of female power.
Witchy Memes are highly encouraged, as well as pop culture references, life advice, and general discussions from a mystical and/or spiritual perspective. Open minds and a sense of humor are required.
If a gender is to be assumed, that gender must be female. If you would not like to be assumed female, please use a different gender-specific or androgynous "‚òâ" flair.
This subreddit is a Safe Space for Women, BIPOC, and anyone in the LGTBQ+ community. We are Sisters, not Cisters. If you do not consider yourself an ally, then this subreddit is not for you.
WitchesVsPatriarchy is curated to maintain a warm, hopeful, healing, supportive, and uplifting environment.

Caliban and the Witch is a history of the transition to capitalism. In it, Silvia Federici argues that the witch hunts of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries served to create and enforce a newly established role in society for women, who were consigned to unpaid reproductive labour to satisfy the needs of an ascendant capitalist order.
Witchcraft, Gender, & Marxism is a video essay by Philosophy Tube inspired by Silvia Federici's writings.
In her TED talk, The Urgency of Intersectionality Kimberl√© Crenshaw explains how and why she coined the term and reminds us to #SayHerName.
