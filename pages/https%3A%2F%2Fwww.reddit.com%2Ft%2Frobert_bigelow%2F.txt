Various people connected to the UFO subject are also connected to "cold fusion" research which the DOE is now openly funding and investigating. Hal Puthoff, SRI, Pharis Williams (and potentially Robert Bigelow), the Navy, the DIA, and NASA are all involved deeply in this research.
I know this sounds crazy, but I have the receipts and you just need to hear me out and follow along. I know I'm talking about two taboo subjects at once the connection may not be immediately obvious to some people. This also may be lots of brand new information for some people.
I had a background interest in fusion energy before getting deep into researching the ufo topic. I have been pointing out on this sub for awhile that nuclear energy would be the most likely source of energy for ufos that display advanced propulsion. If you look at the physics it's hard to deny this. Once I got hooked on the ufo subject after 2017 I started researching the AAWSAP DIRD's as soon as they became available because I knew the only verified documents from the most recent publicly verified UFO investigation since Project Blue Book would be a good place to start. Immediately I recognized the multiple reports of different fusion concepts which encouraged me to dive deeper into exploring energy as well as how energy relates to propulsion especially nonconventional propulsion. This led me to research electric propulsion concepts such as magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and electrohydrodynamics (EHD) as well as the most recent advances in compact nuclear power sources and theoretical research into warping space-time. All of this stuff is in the DIRD's. What I'm going to explore below is not in the DIRD's. However, people associated with the UFO topic such as Hal Puthoff are verified as being involved in the subject and there are claims that connect Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace who also was responsible for the investigations at Skinwalker Ranch as well as the creation of AAWSAP. That makes this a potentially huge thread to pull as it was the disclosure of AAWSAP that coincided with the release of the videos and rise of TTSA.
TLDR; There's an abundance of evidence that there is something to "cold fusion" and Bigelow may have funded research from a Los Alamos National Labs nuclear physicist into it and Hal Puthoff definitely has researched it with a former SRI experimental physicist. Ronald Richter, the former nazi scientist, may have reported cold fusion long before 1989. NASA has confirmed lattice confinement fusion is real in 2 peer-reviewed papers and most people apparently have missed that this is "cold fusion." If Williams' theory is correct, magnetic fields should strongly effect lattice confinement fusion and such a prediction would confirm his theory which also predicts a coupling of the electric field to gravity.

The Department of Energy (DOE) announced in Sept. of 2022 that it was funding up to $10M to study Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) aka “cold fusion.” The official announcement can be viewed here. This subject has been known to go by dozens of different terminologies such as solid state fusion, lattice enhanced fusion, lattice confined fusion, etc. The topic is typically scoffed at by most members of the scientific community as pseudoscience. So, why is the DOE funding it?
The short answer is that there are numerous credentialed scientists interested in the topic despite the dismissive attitude of academia. It turns out that there are a plethora of interesting results and the recent interest is shared by more than just the DOE. There are numerous academic institutions involved in the research and even NASA is studying the subject. There’s even interest in it by members of Silicon Valley and investors. Although there is admittedly no clear consensus for an underlying theory for the many reported anomalous results it appears a consensus among some less risk averse individuals is that there’s something here worth exploring. A conference (all videos available to view here) was held in October of 2022 in which members of the DOE program, NASA researchers, Google researchers, investors, and others presented on the topic. Presenters referenced patents, shared peer-reviewed papers, examples of repeatable experiments, replicated experiments and discussed next steps moving forward. It was expressed that there needed to be collaborative efforts to design a proof of concept demonstration worthy of publication in the most esteemed peer-reviewed journals in order to move the subject forward.
In the presentation by Dr. Florian Metzler (who is a nuclear engineer) he argues that the controversy over the field is indicative of the process of formation and compares it to the history of the transistor. Interestingly, he points out that some of the first reports of fusion were in a metal lattice in 1922 by Wendt and Irion. It was also reported by Paneth and Peter in 1926. It’s worth mentioning that Paneth was once the director of the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry.
Dr. Metzler doesn’t mention the reported results of Ronald Richter who announced controlled fusion results in Argentina in 1951. The scientific community concluded he was a fraud because he refused to allow outsiders to examine his reactor but it’s interesting to note that his announcement sparked US fusion research and according to his description resembles what we would now call “cold fusion.” He even was suspected of using lithium hydride which has a metal lattice. Among the many different approaches discussed at the conference was lattice confinement fusion which NASA announced in 2020 they demonstrated in two peer-reviewed papers using “deuterated” erbium as part of an effort to seek a new energy source for deep-space exploration missions. Perhaps Richter wasn’t a fraud after all and fell into the same LENR trap as many others. Cornelis Jan Baaker visited Richter to inspect the fusion claims and there is a CIA document titled ‘Meetings of Cornelis Jan Baaker and Ronald Richter in Argentina’ but it’s difficult to make sense of it.
NASA also signed a contract in 2017 with Global Energy Corporation (GEC) for development and testing of a high power space generator. GEC also had a presence at the presentation and a 2022 conference paper titled “Molten Salt Lattice Confinement Fusion (LCF) Fast Fission Reactor for Lunar and Planetary Surface Power.” Some members of GEC also hold a 2003 patent for “System and method for generating particles” which basically claims transmutation and is assigned to JWK international Corp. JWK is affiliated with SPAWAR. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is now called NAVWAR and in 2009 they apparently boasted 20 years of researching LENR. If you do the math on that they have been studying it since the famous 1989 Pons-Fleischmann announcement.
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) also had an investigator that has studied LENR since 1989 named Michael McKubrewho presented at the conference. In 2007 he published a brief prospective on his work and in 2018 it was announced that SRI independently verified the LENR Reactions of Brillouin Energy. The technical report can be found here.
Another researcher formerly associated with SRI named Ken Shoulders also was once involved in this field and his work was mentioned at the conference. Ken Shoulders was a pioneering experimental physicist in microelectronics and drone technology. He worked with Dr. Hal Puthoff to investigate what he called Exotic Vacuum Objects (EVO’s.) He patented some of the technology and even pursued a patent for transmutation that was apparently denied by the patent office. This author has done extensive primary research into Ken Shoulders’ work. It’s also worth noting that the Safire Project was mentioned during a questioning session at the conference and Hal Puthoff has been associated with investigating that work as well.
Another researcher this author has covered that appears to be entirely or largely unknown to the LENR community is a Los Alamos National Labs (LANL) nuclear physicist named Pharis Williams. Williams was of the highest rank of classification for handling nuclear material and existed largely outside of academia as well as LENR research. However, he authored many technical papers for LANL, the Navy, and at least one for the Air Force Space Technology Center. He was allowed to spend half his time at LANL to work on his own unified field theory and published it in 1988. Surprisingly, in it he predicts that fusion of hydrogen into helium by lowering the Coulomb barrier is possible which is precisely what many in the LENR field report. Williams also proposed this could be done using “the crystal lattice of a metal under a high magnetic field that locks up [the hydrogen] spin axis in the correct orientation.” He even patented thisdesign in 2013 shortly before his death. This author also uncovers how he is on camera twice claiming that this research was being funded by silent investors and in a 2017 self published book by Colonel John Alexander, Alexander claims that Robert Bigelow of Bigelow Aerospace funded Williams’ research. It’s worth pointing out that there is little evidence indicating anyone in the LENR community is looking into using magnetic fields to enhance their Helium products. If Williams’ theory is correct they should, especially if using lattice confinement approaches, be able to put a regular commercial magnet next to the material and see an increase in helium fusion products.
Another interesting person listed on a 2022 DOE LENR workshop was former NASA scientist Harold White who was representing the Limitless Space Institute which is interested in future advances for deep space travel, a topic of which touches on technology trends this author has covered many times.
One researcher at the conference, George Egely, traces LENR research all the way back to Tesla and Henry Thomas Moray. This author has also seen Moray’s work come up in the Air Force Space Technology Center document linked in the Pharis Williams’ research above. The involvement of Carl Eyring is interesting as the Eyring Institute is known to have connections to top secret government projects.
Some other notable mentions at the conference are claims of direct energy conversion and interest from Silicon Valley in funding LENR research. Even famed technology investor Peter Diamandis of the X-Prize Foundation makes an appearance.
This article is far from comprehensive and perhaps the best way to end it is with the presentation by Dr. Oliver Barham’s, the project manager at US Navy Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division (NSWC-IHD), presentation titled, ‘A Rising Scientific Tide Will Lift All Boats’ in which he explains how the topic has had increasing acceptance to peer review, but much more work needs to be done to convince the larger scientific community.
Aerospace Billionaire Robert Bigelow who previously owned Skinwalker Ranch says Aliens-UFOs are linked with consciousness. He claimed to see "Interdimensional" forces and says there is risks of trying to establish communications with the unknown.
Former Skinwalker Ranch Owner Robert Bigelow says "They are among us" and is holding back evidence to prevent disclosure

Various people connected to the UFO subject are also connected to "cold fusion" research which the DOE is now openly funding and investigating. Hal Puthoff, SRI, Pharis Williams (and potentially Robert Bigelow), the Navy, the DIA, and NASA are all involved deeply in this research. PART 2
I posted PART 1 of this research and it got a lot of attention. I've been doing some more digging and I've found more connections, uncovered more players, and found a significant breakthrough in understanding the work of Ken Shoulders. If you are unaware, Dr. Hal Puthoff who is well known for his association with the UFO subject as an insider, once worked very closely with Ken Shoulders who was an experimental physicist also at SRI. Ken pioneered microelectronics and drone technology before most people had even heard of either. He also worked on a strange new form of energy in the form of condensed balls of plasma he called Exotic Vacuum Objects (EVO's.) I have conducted primary research corroborating this work including his claims that EVO's could be used for transmutation and explain "cold fusion."
Dr. Hal Puthoff has also been associated with investigating the Safire Project. This is a group of people working with plasma's that have claimed to have documented unexpected transmutations and anomalous heat, but (most importantly) the ability to have precise control over the process. George Hathaway of Hathaway Research International (HRI) formerly known as Hathaway Consulting, is on the Safire Project team. Hathaway also investigated John Hutchison of the Hutchison effect, which Colonel John Alexander is also known to have investigated. What's even more interesting is Hathaway authored 2 of the AAWSAP DIRD's. He authored Superconductors in Gravity Research and Maverick vs Corporate Research Cultures. Of course Dr. Hal Puthoff authored one of the DIRD's, Advanced Space Propulsion Based on Vacuum (Spacetime Metrics) Engineering.
Another interesting author in the list of DIRD's who I mentioned in a follow up post on my subreddit r/observingtheanomaly (where I cover more than just UFO's) without even realizing it is Dr. George Miley who wrote Inertial Electrostatics Confinement Fusion. I find his name interesting not just because of his work into LENR, but because of his work into DPF and aneutronic fusion including specifically DPF aneutronic fusion powered air breathing aerospace vehicles predicted to be developable by 2025. You may notice that it resembles very much my own recent work into the same subject matter. It get's even more interesting that one of Miley's co-authors for that paper wrote a paper for the Air Force in 1972 Advanced Propulsion Concepts - Project Outgrowth for Edwards AF Base that covers not only electric propulsion and nuclear propulsion, but air breathing concepts as well. In fact, it covers most of what the AAWSAP DIRD's cover in one document (including antigravity concepts) and was written in the 70's. It even discusses power beaming and a strong desire to create vehicles that can be consistently powered by utilizing the the environment for energy sources. So, Miley appears to have his fingers in a lot of pies.
But I digress. Back to George Hathaway who wrote 2 of the DIRD's and is involved with the Safire Project. I've recently learned he worked with Hal Puthoff on replicating Ken Shoulder's work with EVO's. Bob Greenyer recently interviewed him about this and he gives a great presentation on how to set up an experimental apparatus to create EVO's! If you use my work on Shoulders along with this simple diagram I think that should give you all you need to start experimenting with EVO's.
I cover Williams in PART 1 which also has links to in depth coverage of his theory and how it all relates. In a nutshell Williams' basically patented lattice confinement fusion before NASA published papers in peer review that it was possible and created a theory to explain how in certain cases previously unexpected aneutronic fusion could take place by overcoming the coulomb barrier. Interestingly, he predicts hydrogen to helium which is exactly what many "cold fusion" results report. Of course, Colonel John Alexander claims Robert Bigelow funded this work as I provide evidence for if you thoroughly read PART 1 and all the links.
I've since noticed that the patent states, "$25,000 was received in 2008 from NSWC, Indian Head Division, to design experiments, review reports, and analyze data. The experiments verified heating using powered/granulated fuel." Notice NSWC Indian Head division is also the same division involved in the most recent DOE LENR research. Coincidence? Probably not.
I've found another recent video uploaded by the Martin Fleischmann Memorial Project in which some Russian researchers discuss experimental results that suggest nuclear electrons may exist. The discussion begins at 7:44 and immediately I realized that this is exactly what Pharis Williams' claims in his theory. He explains how he mathematically arrived at a way to describe the neutron as a proton plus an electron and that this configuration is why it's possible to overcome the Coulomb barrier and why fusion into helium takes place.
I uncovered evidence that Robert Bigelow funded the research of a Q level clearance Los Alamos National Labs nuclear physicist that was working on a form of fusion as well as electro-gravitics
I uncovered this and shared it multiple times in multiple places including here, to little response. But, it's a big deal. Bigelow is known for many things in this community, but not for this. And it matters.
TLDR; The physics of advanced energy and propulsion was likely funded by Bigelow and these details are 100% new to the UFO community. There is tons of evidence in the form of a paper trail of official documents.
Energy and propulsion funded by Bigelow has been overlooked by the funding of BAAS, NIDS, Skinwalker, AAWSAP/AATIP, etc. Most are aware of those stories, but not this one. And the connection was only uncovered because of the Oke Shannon interview by Project Unity about the Admiral Wilson Memo. In this Oke Shannon mentions that perhaps someone tested Pharis Williams' theory. So I went digging deep into who Williams was and his theory only to uncover plenty of evidence that he's a legit physicist with a legit theory with profound implications. This nuclear physicist was working on a form of low energy nuclear reactions or LENR aka cold fusion and he claimed on camera that someone was secretly funding it in 2009. He even patented it in 2013 but died in 2014. A wealth of knowledge exists in the public domain about his theory, how to test it, and also the operation of the reactor.
I published the story on Medium. It's kind of a 2 part. I also published parts of the research here before that in a 4 part series of posts. I tried sharing the story on twitter after the Brandon Fugal story broke on NY Post by Greenstreet about Fugal's purchase of Skinwalker Ranch by Fugal from Bigelow and he actually "liked" it. He was the only one lol. Why is the community refusing to look at this evidence?

Below is the Medium article.https://medium.com/@Observing_The_Anomaly/exploring-5-dimensions-the-dynamic-theory-of-pharis-williams-a-new-view-of-space-time-matter-5126262ab5f
I even made a YouTube video version because it's a long read.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSIDAuReupc&t=1s
