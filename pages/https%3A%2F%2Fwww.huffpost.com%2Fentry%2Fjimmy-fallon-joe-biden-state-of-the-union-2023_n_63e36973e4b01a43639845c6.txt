Joe Biden Messes With China In Spoof SOTU Entry On ‘The Tonight Show’
Reporter, HuffPost
Jimmy Fallon joked about how President Joe Biden could have trolled China with his entrance to his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
“The Tonight Show” host aired a spoof video of Biden riding into the House on a hot air balloon, a nod to the U.S. shooting down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the South Carolina coast over the weekend.
Fallon recorded his monologue before Biden’s address, but made some accurate predictions as to how it would go down — including lots of Democrats clapping and Republicans sitting still and “not having any fun.”
