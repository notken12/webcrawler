LPT: When using text messages or IMs for business, say everything you need to say in the first message. Don’t just say “hi” or “are you busy”.
There’s nothing worse than being interrupted at work, switching attention to a message that’s just a “hi”, and then waiting for the sender to type what they really want to say. Especially if it’s something sensitive and they take a while to type, check, and hesitate before sending. It can also cause anxiety because then I as the recipient have no choice but to wait and wonder what’s going on.
Also there’s no need to say hi, how are you, and make small talk before getting to the purpose of the message. If you’re already messaging me you don’t need permission to talk. There’s a time and place for politeness but this medium is about communicating efficiently. Just send the message, ask your question or make your point, and be done.
It’s called instant messaging for a reason.
