Reddit - Dive into anything

<START>Old Disney store

Lol are we siblings?
Mom?
I always wanted Simba ðŸ¥º
Said every parent in the mall that day. And I was ok with it, that place was so expensive
Those small plushies are 35 dollars now you know why your mom said that. They're also the cheapest thing in the Disney store.
Oh my God I remember that video playing! This is the part right before Max cradles Sonic's pregnant belly!
My parents said even a keychain was too expensive.

Always wanted to dive in there when I was a kid like it was a ball pit
I remember seeing the tiered shelves under all the stuffed animals and being so disappointed it wasn't just a giant pile.
I wanted to climb. So badly.
I did that. Itâ€™s all shelves underneath. Instant regret lmfao
Having worked in a Disney Store which had one of these, I would advise against it.
We would find all sorts of abandoned trash in there. Half eaten apples, smoothie drinks, diapers, etc.
It was disgusting and we were all made up when they got rid of it.
My friend actually did that and his ribs discovered that it wasn't just a pile.
I did this, it hurt. There are rims around the edge to hold the stuffies in place.
