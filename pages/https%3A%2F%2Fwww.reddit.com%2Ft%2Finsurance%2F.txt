LPT: Procedure you know is covered by insurance, but insurance denies your claim.
Sometimes you have to pay for a procedure out of pocket even though its covered by insurance and then get insurance to reimburse you. Often times when this happens insurance will deny the claim multiple times citing some outlandish minute detail that was missing likely with the bill code or something. If this happens, contact your states insurance commissioner and let them work with your insurance company. Insurance companies are notorious for doing this. Dont let them get away with it.
