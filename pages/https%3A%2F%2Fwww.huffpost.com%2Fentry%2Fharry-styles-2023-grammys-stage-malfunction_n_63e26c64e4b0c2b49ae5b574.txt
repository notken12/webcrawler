Harry Styles' Dancers Blame Tech Mishap For Chaotic Grammys Performance
Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost
Several of Harry Styles‚Äô backup dancers are speaking out after the pop star‚Äôs performance at the 2023 Grammy Awards drew a mixed response from fans.
The former One Direction member took the stage at Sunday‚Äôs ceremony to perform ‚ÄúAs It Was,‚Äù the smash lead single off his third solo album, ‚ÄúHarry‚Äôs House.‚Äù During the number, he and a troupe of dancers re-created moves from the song‚Äôs music video atop a revolving turntable similar to a record player.
Still, many felt that Styles didn‚Äôt seem like his high-energy self and that the performance came across as haphazard. In response, dancers Brandon Mathis and Dexter Da Rocha shared their thoughts on the experience in social media videos in which they said a technical malfunction was to blame.
‚ÄúThe moment the curtain opened and it was time to perform, our turntable started spinning in reverse, backward, freaking all of us out on live television,‚Äù Mathis explained in a short video posted to his Instagram Stories. ‚ÄúThere was nothing we could do to stop it ... in real time, we have to troubleshoot and try to do a complete piece in reverse. Talk about professionalism.‚Äù
The technical difficulty was the stage spinning the wrong way as soon as they stepped on it üò≠üò≠ PROFESSIONALS cause they still killed it having to change it right at the last second pic.twitter.com/s9OJaEO808
Da Rocha, who uses they/them pronouns, echoed those sentiments in a since-deleted TikTok video, noting that the performance had been ‚Äúspotless and beautiful‚Äù in rehearsals just hours before the Grammy Awards were set to air.
‚ÄúThe performance starts, and the turntable starts going the wrong way,‚Äù they said, noting that several dancers tried to alert a backstage technician to the blunder but were unable to do so with cameras rolling.
‚ÄúSo we got accustomed to one way, and it was the opposite way,‚Äù they continued. ‚ÄúLuckily we worked together and did our best and got to one cool formation in time for the overhead shot, but had to kind of change the rest.‚Äù

A representative for the Recording Academy, which presents the Grammy Awards each year, confirmed Mathis‚Äô and Da Rocha‚Äôs accounts in a statement, telling E! News that ‚Äúunexpected things happen in live television,‚Äù but that ‚ÄúHarry showed he was the ultimate pro in not missing a beat.‚Äù
In a separate Instagram post, Mathis praised Styles for being ‚Äúa kick ass down to earth human being who truly cares about what he‚Äôs doing and who he‚Äôs doing it with,‚Äù before alluding to ‚Äúridiculous technical difficulties that none of us could have prepared for.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs I started this off saying, moments like this do not happen often and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to have been a part,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúUntil next time.‚Äù
Fortunately for Styles, the night ended up on a triumphant note, with ‚ÄúHarry‚Äôs House‚Äù nabbing the coveted Album of the Year Grammy in what‚Äôs been widely interpreted as an upset over Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúRenaissance.‚Äù
