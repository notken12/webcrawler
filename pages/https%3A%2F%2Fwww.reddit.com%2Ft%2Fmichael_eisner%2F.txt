New here - what's the deal with Michael Eisner?
Hey. My intro into the channel was the FastPass video, and I really loved it - I'm not really into theme parks, but I'm a doctoral student in mathematics and learning about queueing theory and an industrial application of it was really interesting to me. I've watched a bunch of other videos - Handwich is a particular favorite - and it seems like Eisner is brought up and ridiculed again and again, both in the videos and in the comments. So, as someone with no experience in the history of theme parks - why do people make fun of Eisner so much?
Bob Chapek = Michael Eisner
I hope Kevin does an Michael Eisner retrospective at some point.
Michael Eisner is a common feature in most of the episodes about Disney parks and media. I’m fascinated by him and his huge impact on pop culture. It’s unfortunate that there isn’t an episode, or series of episodes, about Eisner the way there were about Jim Henson.
1992 First Edition Walt Disney Co. Phone Directory. Michael Eisner, Marty Sklar, Tony Baxter, Dave Smith. Wild to see all these names, must have been peak time to work at Disney!
Why isn't there a Michael Eisner fanfic?
I'm just saying what we are thinking. Since Michael Eisner has become a mascot of the Disney History Fandom.
Edit: nothing sexual though
Mini Michael Eisner auto with my retro EPCOT mug just feels right.
