Dude, where‚Äôs your chemistry?
Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher proved to be the antithesis of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac on the red carpet during two recent film premiere appearances.
The actors looked like they had just won the Hunger Games as they posed for publicity shots on Jan. 30 and Feb. 2 for their upcoming Netflix rom-com, ‚ÄúYour Place or Mine,‚Äù in which the two play, uh, love interests.
It‚Äôs unclear why the two seemed so uncomfortable that they literally looked like they‚Äôd been Photoshopped next to each other ‚Äî but our guess is that Kutcher told Witherspoon he didn‚Äôt like her latest book club pick. Or Witherspoon told Kutcher she bought the ticket he had to sell back for one of billionaire Richard Branson‚Äôs Virgin Galactic flights.
To be fair, the two also had some shots in which they look like they‚Äôre having fun together ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ But it‚Äôs hard to ignore the handful of pictures that appear as stiff as a Sears studio family portrait.
So much so that fans on Twitter couldn‚Äôt help but make fun of the awkward pics.
‚Äúget a room omg!!!‚Äù one Twitter user joked of one of the shots.
But the sarcasm didn‚Äôt end there.
the chemistry is insane!!!!
to have a bond like them!! üòç
this is top notch pda.

But one Twitter user offered a different theory:
I choose to believe the Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon romcom is about to be so spicy they needed to look like they hated each other for the press tour to avoid drama üèº
Even Kutcher‚Äôs wife, Mila Kunis, called her husband and Witherspoon out for their odd photos.
Witherspoon, who stars on Apple TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Morning Show,‚Äù explained on ‚ÄúToday With Hoda & Jenna‚Äù that Kunis emailed her after the photos were published.
‚ÄúShe goes, ‚ÄòYou guys look so awkward on the red carpet together,‚Äô‚Äù Witherspoon explained.
But the ‚ÄúBig Little Lies‚Äù star also said on the show that there‚Äôs no tension between her and Kutcher.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so professional. He‚Äôs the funniest guy. I mean, such a goofball. We had so much fun, and every time he‚Äôd wear a funny outfit, I‚Äôd text Mila. I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòWhat is he wearing?‚Äô‚Äù
