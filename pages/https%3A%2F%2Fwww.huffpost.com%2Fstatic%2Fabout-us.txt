At HuffPost, we report with empathy and put people at the heart of every story. We take a people-first approach in everything we report—be it news and politics or lifestyle and entertainment—and we cover real stories about real life. Regardless of who you are, where you live or what you believe, you can count on HuffPost to help you navigate what’s happening in the world and how it affects you. We consider the needs, passions and curiosity of our readers in all of our journalism. If something matters to our readers, it matters to us.
At HuffPost we:

We believe diversity – in who we are, in the audience we write for and in whose stories we tell – is critical to our mission. We aim to write for, and not just about, those left out of traditional power structures; to approach stories inclusively; and to serve a diverse audience with stories that matter to them. This means including a diverse range of voices in our reporting, actively pursuing diversity in our newsroom, and listening to our readers and viewers to make sure we're as open and responsive as possible.

HuffPost endeavors to be accurate in its reporting, transparent and thorough in its sourcing, and fair and independent in its analysis. HuffPost strives to verify and corroborate information via multiple sources whenever possible. HuffPost grants anonymity to sources so they can provide information in the public interest without putting themselves at risk; HuffPost does not grant anonymity to sources so they can avoid accountability for their opinions.
HuffPost works to correct any misstatements in a timely manner, with a correction note appended to the bottom of an article to indicate what has been fixed and how. More prominent notices may be included for more egregious errors. HuffPost will only retract an article after extensive review by a senior editor has found fundamental flaws in the reporting, and always with an editor's note.
HuffPost includes labeling to indicate when an article is advertising content (including sponsored content), and we disclose relationships with outside partners who may underwrite any area of coverage.
HuffPost is owned by digital content company BuzzFeed, Inc.
