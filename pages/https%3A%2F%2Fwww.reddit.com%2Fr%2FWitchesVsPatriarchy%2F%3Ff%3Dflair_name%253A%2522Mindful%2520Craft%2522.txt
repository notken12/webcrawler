About
Though women-centric, we welcome all beings interested in using their esoteric powers to destroy the Patriarchy and all its constraints on women, men, and everybody in between and beyond.
Taking a more historic approach to the concept of witches, this sub is meant to channel the spirit of the women who were persecuted in witch trials worldwide as part of a thinly veiled systemic oppression of female power.
Witchy Memes are highly encouraged, as well as pop culture references, life advice, and general discussions from a mystical and/or spiritual perspective. Open minds and a sense of humor are required.
If a gender is to be assumed, that gender must be female. If you would not like to be assumed female, please use a different gender-specific or androgynous "☉" flair.
This subreddit is a Safe Space for Women, BIPOC, and anyone in the LGTBQ+ community. We are Sisters, not Cisters. If you do not consider yourself an ally, then this subreddit is not for you.
WitchesVsPatriarchy is curated to maintain a warm, hopeful, healing, supportive, and uplifting environment.

Witchy content is most encouraged! It doesn't have to be feminist, but witchy+feminist+humorous will score you extra points.
WVP is curated to maintain a warm, hopeful, supportive, and uplifting environment. Content that is better suited to other subs may be removed. Posts that provoke outrage, or focus on negative or anti-feminist behavior will be removed.
Trauma-heavy posts may be directed to other subs or will be removed if they reach a certain karma limit. Titles must be neutral in regard to upsetting content.
We allow self-promotion (including selfies) as long as it is witchy/feminist and not spammy.

Basic Definition of Patriarchy
Caliban and the Witch is a history of the transition to capitalism. In it, Silvia Federici argues that the witch hunts of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-centuries served to create and enforce a newly established role in society for women, who were consigned to unpaid reproductive labour to satisfy the needs of an ascendant capitalist order.
Witchcraft, Gender, & Marxism is a video essay by Philosophy Tube inspired by Silvia Federici's writings.
In her TED talk, The Urgency of Intersectionality Kimberlé Crenshaw explains how and why she coined the term and reminds us to #SayHerName.
This subreddit supports the Black Lives Matter movement.
Angela Davis explains how our notions of Revolution need to be far more capacious.
