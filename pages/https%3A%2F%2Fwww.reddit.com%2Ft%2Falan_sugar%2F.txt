Thoughts on Alan sugar?
Watching this years Apprentice 2023, I feel like everything has lost its grittiness and lustre. Alan Sugar has really mellowed since becoming a billionaire and has lost his edgeâ€¦
From Sir Alanâ€™s cringeworthy shitty jokes that everyone is forced to laugh ðŸ˜‚ at because there scared to get fired x
Claude has lot his aura of ruthlessness because seeing him in the interviews made him more fearsome and have a presence, seeing him all the time cuts that fear factor off.
The candidates are vacuous and somewhat shallow but lack real substance and charisma. I miss Nick and Margaret as they seemed like a voice of reason x And they balanced Sir Alanâ€™s critical coldness with a balanced fair approach
Itâ€™s become way to shallow with shooting in all these exotic locations and all these lip fillers, plastic surgery x Even from a superficial perspective as a man the woman are not that attractive they got nothing on Liz, Shandeesh or Luisa zissman from the previous episodes x
Where is the ruthless corporate edge gone?
