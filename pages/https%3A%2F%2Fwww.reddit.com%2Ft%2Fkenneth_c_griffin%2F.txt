#ChelseaFC Please do your due diligence on Kenneth C Griffin. He has a history of violating numerous SEC Rules & Regulations. #KenGriffinLied
We’ve all seen the 1/14 Financial Times “Ken Griffin, financial prodigy turned industry giant” article by Robin Wigglesworth that Kenneth C. Griffin paid for --- But did you know: Citadel also posted that article on Citadel.com 6 days later to manipulate Google search results and SEO page rankings?
If you thought Kenneth C. Griffin thanking us was bad, wait until you see his full quote that the New York Times edited out. It doesn’t get anymore backwards than this.
@RepJuanVargas Sir, any comment on being lied to by @citsecurities CEO Kenneth C. Griffin? Personally, as a vet and law-abiding citizen of this great country, I would be too afraid to lie to a man of your stature under oath Flag of United States#KenGriffinLied #kengriffenlied
