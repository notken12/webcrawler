Iâ€™ve used Ernie Ball Slinkyâ€™s for a long time, and I want strings that last a little longer. What did you all switch to, or what do you recommend?
The New Ernie Ball Music Man looks like the Tesla Cyber Truck of guitars
[GEAR] I got tired of looking up Ernie Ball string sets constantly, so I made a list this morning.
I thought someone else who's as OCD as I am about their guitar strings might find this useful. It's a list of all the different electric six string sets made by Ernie Ball, with their string gauges.

Can anyone explain the Sterling by Stingray SUB Ray Music Man by Ernie Ball naming system?
why do these basses have like 6 names? And what's with "SUB", why does that part seem to come and go on the same basic instrument?
[Gear] For Christmas, I got to visit with James Valentine (Maroon 5), and he signed my new Ernie Ball Valentine Signature. He's extremely kind, personable, and down to earth.
We spent about 30 minutes chatting. He told stories of his band, the music industry, and the private acoustic shows he recently did. He also asked about my music, my other guitars and my career.
I'm so grateful to him for taking the time to visit on Christmas, and for people who admire his guitar work, rest assured that he's also awesome on a personal level!

Fender Player Plus Active Precision or Ernie Ball Music Man
I am a current guitar player looking to get my first bass.
I'm currently between the
Fender Player Plus Active Precision and an Ernie Ball Music Man (single H).
I have been to GC a couple times to try both out and I have been viewing demos online as well. However, I am still not sure which one to choose.
If I could, I would buy both lol, but I want to stick to one for now.
So, need some help friends. Which one would you prefer/choose if you were in my situation?
Opinions and thoughts are appreciated.
Thank you.
First time VI owner, but Iâ€™ll forego the shell pink gloat to talk about strings. I got a pack of Fender Bass VI Strings (24-100) after hearing not great things about the Ernie ball Bass VI set and these things are so long. Anyone got experience with the Ernie ball set and if they are okay?
Ernie Ball Music Man StingRay, Feb 1995, w/ "Flea bridge" ðŸŽ¸ Since I started playing bass from the fascination of Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Aeroplane", getting this instrument was a matter of time. The instrument is from February 1995, which is the period when Flea was a Music Man endorser.
