<START>Yes kids, back in the day, we’d have to remove the faceplates from our car stereos so they wouldn’t get stolen
A person I used to know left his on, his car got broken into but all they had time to steal was the faceplate. Since you couldn't buy them separately this guy had the bright idea to go into the store, take one off a demo model, then pretend it was his from his car while walking out. Didn't work and he got arrested for shoplifting.
10/10 Surprising conclusion!
Someone broke into my car in college and stole just the faceplate. I was so mad because like you say you can't just buy them separately.
You can and could buy the faceplates separately for almost all models that were removable.
Twist ending.

But 95% of us just took the face off and stashed it under the seat or something.
Glove box for me. I thought I was so smart.
Mine got caught pulling it from under the seat, got bent somehow and the CD player wouldn't eject. Had the Josie and the Pussycats stuck in there for 3 years.
I always took my faceplate with me. Came back to the parking lot one afternoon. The cops were there interviewing two other people who had their radios stolen. Both had stashed the faceplate in the car. There were two thieves in the crew. One would remove the radio while the other scoured the car for the faceplate. My radio showed evidence of attempted removal, but they never completed the job--no faceplate so not worth taking the radio.

My pops had a friend who would take the nice face off, and put on an old beat up 8track face. He thought if a robber saw a cheap radio in your car, they won't bother breaking in.
The other 5% of us stashed it and couldn't remember where.
I had the version prior to this where the whole stereo slid out with a little handle--then what? I put it under the seat. I had a jeep without doors (sometimes). The 90s were fun. Edit: I think both types were being sold at the same time and the market was trying out options to thwart theft--the faceplate was easy to put in a purse or backpack. Everyone had crappy car alarms too--aftermarket since only expensive and new cars came with alarms. Or you could just install a LED and thieves would think it was an alarm.
And I had a stereo and sound system worth more than my car
