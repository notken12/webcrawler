My friend has a life sized cutout of Colonel Sanders, set up like an altar, in his bedroom.
Went in there with him for a second and saw it. He didn’t acknowledge it. I asked why, he said “I dunno, I just admire him”, then offered no further explanation. There were candles in front of it. This guy is 32. He makes me hopeful for my 30s.
